# RFC #1256 §I4 — observer is OFF the pipeline's critical path.
#
# The §I4 fail-open contract requires that EventStore persistence
# cannot weaken cancellation, phase deadlines, or the top-level run
# budget. The naive shape (`await self.event_store.append(...)` inline)
# violates this because `AutoPipeline.run` wraps the driver in
# `asyncio.wait_for(self.interview_driver.run(state, ledger),
# timeout=_deadline_capped_timeout(...))` at
# `src/ouroboros/auto/pipeline.py:602`, and the cap can validly fall
# BELOW the observer's own fail-open bound when the top-level deadline
# is nearly expired (or when `phase_timeout_seconds(INTERVIEW)` is
# set to 1 via persisted/env policy). A bounded inline await still
# spends the remaining pipeline budget — bot review on commit
# 4fd6cfc1 (req_1779890159_141) reproduced this: a 5 s slow `opened`
# append + `asyncio.wait_for(driver.run(...), timeout=0.1)` raised
# `TimeoutError` after ~0.102 s, before `_run_inner` ever ran.
#
# The fix moves the append off the critical path entirely:
# `_emit_event` schedules a background `asyncio.Task` and returns
# immediately. The pipeline's wait_for never sees observer latency.
# Each background task is still bounded by
# `_EVENT_STORE_EMIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` so a stuck observer cannot
# leak indefinitely; exceptions and timeouts are downgraded to
# typed structlog warnings.
#
# Tasks are tracked on `_pending_emit_tasks` so tests/operators can
# `await driver.wait_for_pending_emits()` for deterministic
# inspection. The set is cleared via `add_done_callback` so it never
# grows unbounded.
_EVENT_STORE_EMIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 1.0

# RFC #1256 §I4 — durability is a COMPOSITION-ROOT responsibility.
#
# The driver intentionally does NOT drain ``_pending_emit_tasks``
# inside ``run()``. Two prior bot blockers explain why both extremes
# fail:
#
# * Fire-and-forget with no drain anywhere (commit ef0fec17,
#   req_1779891123_145) silently loses every event when the owning
#   event loop closes — the bot reproduced this with a 0.01 s append
#   store and ``asyncio.run(driver.run(...))``.
# * Drain inside ``run()`` (commit c5549124, req_1779938459_153)
#   re-introduces observer latency on the pipeline-critical path:
#   ``AutoPipeline.run`` wraps ``driver.run`` in
#   ``asyncio.wait_for(..., timeout=interview_timeout)``, so even a
#   50 ms drain after a 0.08 s ``_run_inner`` converts a completed
#   interview into an interview-phase timeout at the deadline-capped
#   budget (bot probe: ``_run_inner`` at 0.08 s + 0.2 s append +
#   outer 0.1 s ``wait_for`` → ``TimeoutError`` at ~0.102 s).
#
# The stable shape: ``_emit_event`` schedules persistence as a
# background ``asyncio.Task`` and returns immediately; ``run()``
# never awaits the pending set. Composition roots (``AutoPipeline``
# is the production owner today; future CLI/MCP composition roots
# when the next wiring slice lands) are responsible for calling
# ``await driver.wait_for_pending_emits()`` — typically under their
# own bounded shield — OUTSIDE their critical ``wait_for`` boundary so:
#
#   1. The §I4 substrate contract — "supply an EventStore, get
#      queryable lifecycle evidence" — is honoured by the post-result
#      drain that the composition root owns.
#   2. The interview phase's hard deadline budget is never spent by
#      observability work; a slow EventStore cannot weaken
#      cancellation, phase timeouts, or top-level deadline
#      enforcement.
#
# ``AutoPipeline.run`` implements this contract via
# ``_drain_interview_observer_events`` (see pipeline.py) on both the
# clean-exit and timeout-exit paths of the interview ``wait_for``,
# with a bounded ``asyncio.shield`` so the drain itself cannot be
# cancelled by a top-level deadline once it begins, and a fail-open
# timeout that downgrades pathologically slow observers to a typed
# structlog warning.

        Issue #1248 — when ``_unsafe_context_reason`` fires during a
        safe-default closure attempt, the SSOT #1157 L5 invariant
        requires escalation through bounded lateral persona reframes
        before falling to BLOCKED. ``self.lateral_thinker`` is the same
        callable shape the EVALUATE → UNSTUCK_LATERAL path uses, so the
        reframe inherits its timeout / error / persona-tracking
        contract.

        Behaviour:

        * Pick the next persona via
          :func:`select_persona_for_safe_default_block`, honoring
          ``state.personas_invoked``.
        * Invoke the lateral thinker once.

          - On **chain exhaustion** (selector returns ``None``), stamp
            the typed ``unstuck_exhausted`` reason on
            ``state.last_error_code`` and return the original
            finalization. The caller's BLOCKED branch then surfaces the
            typed terminal.
          - On **timeout** / **handler exception** / **transient
            ``LateralResult.error``**, record the persona attempt for
            audit + chain progression but leave ``state.last_error_code``
            alone so the existing ``interview_unsafe_gaps_remain`` /
            ``interview_max_rounds_exhausted`` code applies. Only the
            chain-exhausted path stamps ``unstuck_exhausted``.

        * On a successful lateral response, persist the persona's text
          on state for audit (``last_lateral_*``), append the persona
          to ``personas_invoked``, and — only if the response carries
          the canonical ``CLEARANCE: lexical_false_positive`` marker
          (see :func:`_lateral_response_authorizes_demotion`) — demote
          every active CONSERVATIVE_DEFAULT ledger entry to ASSUMPTION
          and snapshot the mutated ledger onto ``state.ledger`` before
          checkpointing so a resume after demotion sees the same input
          the runtime path saw. The re-run of
          :func:`finalize_safe_defaultable_gaps` then either clears
          ``unsafe_gaps`` (returning the new finalization) or surfaces
          the same matcher fire to the next persona.

        The function only mutates the caller's path of execution; the
        existing safe-default closure / BLOCKED branches downstream are
        unchanged. When ``self.lateral_thinker is None`` the caller is
        expected to short-circuit before invoking this method.
